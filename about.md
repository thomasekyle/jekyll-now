I spend most of my day as a systems engineer, but in my free time I like to work on various projects. Most of my experience is geared toward unix/linux, C#, and small/medium sized web development.

### More Information

My girlfriend and I have three cats, and there names are Brent, Mr.Fox, and Arya.
