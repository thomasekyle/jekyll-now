title: New Macbook
---

So after being against Apple (mostly for the dev lockout and crazy expensive hardware...)
I finally broke down and got a Macbook. For the most part I am enjoying trying out macOS.
I am still getting used to the keyboard and new screen. I am thinking about maybe
upgrading to a MacBook pro if I like this Mac enough. I guess we will just have to wait
and see. It seems to be running my programs just fine (Atom, Safari, Term, Mail, Steam)
all at the same time. It does get a little warm when you put load on the CPU, but
the heat dissipates pretty quickly if the load is not sustained.

Here are the specs. (I got the Early 2015 version)
- Core M 5y31
- 8GB RAM
- 256GB SSD
- And a really nice screen
