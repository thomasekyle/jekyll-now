title: Weird, but in a good way
---

So I am one day three of me using my MacBook, and I can say that I am pretty impressed
by this little laptop. I am in love with the gestures for macOS and the way you can
quickly switch between desktops with ease. I can honestly see why people would
purchase this device. I love being able to slide between desktops. I have been also
using elementary OS for quite a little while and I can say that it feels a lot similar
to that distribution. I am still getting used to the keyboard, but I do not dislike as
much as I did yesterday. I haven't had any issues with speed today. There were some issues
yesterday with visual studio, but they were do to a malfunctioning safari. I fixed the issue
and started using it early this morning and it was fine. I still need to get the hang of
using command button instead of the ctrl for various functions, but I believe that will come will
a little bit of time.

I am thinking of trading this device up for a 2016 MacBook pro if it manages to keep my attention. We'll
see though. I have a Dell latitude e5450 that is one of the best laptops I have ever used in my life. :)
