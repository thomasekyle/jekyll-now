title: A post thats not about my MacBook
---

So I won't post about my nice new MacBook today. Instead about a project I started a couple of days ago
called myr. Myr is a tool that assist with configuring and running commands on multiple unix/linux servers.
I wanted a small program that was able to achieve this. I haven't had a chance to look at the way ansible works,
but I can say myr is nowhere near as extensive as any of the other automation tools you can find on the internet.


I am using C# for development at the moment, but I would like to write myr in C/C++ when I get a chance. Installing the
net runtime is not a fun time. Also, it interferes with the philosophy that myr is supposed to be a small tool for managing
and configuring servers. Mono brings a lot of weight and unneeded bulk. I'm using C# now so that I can get a good feel of how
to structure the program. (A I have used C# a lot.)
